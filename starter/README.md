## Detailed changes in the code

-I have given the page a specific name, so that it will be shown on the tab name;
- each image on the main section has an alternative text attribute that will help in case the browser will not be able to download the images and will confirm again what detailed in each section;
-Several changes have been applied to the basecode, so that it's not divided in generic "div" division but with well defined structural section, so that the code looks cleaner, clearer and easier to change in the future. in case the changes affected the css file, those have been amended so that the layout and style of the page is unchanged.

All the changes above have been done to increase visibility through Search Engine Optimization.
